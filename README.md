Requirements:

## Mouse Movements and Interaction Events:

Track and record mouse movements, clicks, and scrolling events using JavaScript event listeners or libraries like 'mousemove.js' or 'clicky'.
Monitor touch events and gestures on mobile devices.
Capture keyboard inputs, input timings, and typing patterns.

## IP Address and Geolocation Information:

Obtain the user's IP address from server-side request headers using back-end programming languages such as PHP, Python, or Node.js.
Use APIs like ip-api.com, IPinfo.io, or MaxMind's GeoIP2 to gather geolocation data, ISP information, and other metadata about the IP address.
Identify and flag suspicious IP addresses, such as those associated with known proxies, VPNs, or Tor exit nodes.

## Browser and Platform Information:

Collect information about the user's browser, platform, and other details using the JavaScript 'navigator' object or libraries like 'Platform.js' or 'UAParser.js'.
Identify and flag uncommon or suspicious browser configurations or user-agent strings.

## Device Fingerprinting:

Use libraries like 'FingerprintJS' or 'ClientJS' to gather device-specific information, such as screen size, browser plugins, and installed fonts, to create a unique device fingerprint.
Identify and flag devices with suspicious or frequently changing fingerprints.

## Request Patterns and Rate Limiting:

Implement rate limiting to prevent automated bots from making too many requests in a short period.
Monitor and analyze the pattern of requests made by users, including request intervals, URLs accessed, and request headers.

## Session and Behavior Analysis:

Analyze user session data, including session duration, time on page, and navigation patterns.
Monitor and flag unusual behavior patterns, such as rapid form submissions, excessive page refreshes, or abnormal browsing sequences.

## Integration with Third-Party Bot Detection Services:

Integrate with third-party services like Google reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare Bot Management, or DataDome for additional layers of bot detection and mitigation.
